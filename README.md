INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING WITH PYTHON (WIP - I still haven't finished the book myself)

This repository works as a notebook which holds the key-points, code and random stuffs that I found important from the book Introduction to Machine learning with Python by Andreas C.Muller and Sarah Guido.

Feel free to take a look around.
